# FE.Restream

A project to help people put on unofficial restreams.  Currently, to have the objective completion checkboxes show up in OBS with a Browser Source, you should be interacting with the actual browser source, and not another instance of the page.

Uses components from my [FeTracker.Common](https://github.com/Antidale/FeTracker.Common) repository

ToDo:

Next steps:
* Add data entry for player data and objectives
* Add Hero selector

Further steps:
* Allow Restreamer and Tracker duties to be different people
  * probably via SignalR?
  * fix objective completion display
* Allow background selection
* Add Go Mode indicator
* Add timer
